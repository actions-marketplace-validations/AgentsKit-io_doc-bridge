# For agents

Use Doc Bridge before changing a module. It returns versioned, runtime-validated data instead of asking a model to infer ownership from the entire repository.

```bash
ak-docs query ownership <id> --agent
```

The response supplies four things: `startHere`, `readBeforeEditing`, `editRoots`, and `checks`.

For a documentation change, inspect the deterministic audit before editing:

```bash
ak-docs audit documentation --json
```

Treat `blocked` as a stop condition. Treat `not-analyzed` as missing evidence, not as a pass. Agent proposals remain advisory until a human approves them.
