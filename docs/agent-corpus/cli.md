# CLI

Owns public `ak-docs` commands and output modes. Keep JSON output versioned and text output readable.

The documentation audit is a deterministic post-discovery check:

```bash
ak-docs audit documentation --json
```

It reports measurable quality, coverage, stale, contradiction, redundancy, and structure-gap signals. `not-analyzed` means semantic evidence is missing; it is not a pass.

`ak-docs enrich` and `check --enrich` are the only commands that call a Registry agent for
enrichment. A failed, timed-out or malformed enrichment is reported and never changes a check
result or its exit code; `enrich` exits 2 and writes no overlay.
