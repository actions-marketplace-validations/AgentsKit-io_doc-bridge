# Plugins

Owns the analyzer plugin contract and registry. `AnalyzerPluginManifestSchema` defines a plugin's
identity, languages, frameworks, capabilities, and resource limits. `AnalyzerPluginOutputSchema`
validates entities, relations, coverage, and diagnostics. `createAnalyzerRegistry` registers
plugins and routes `analyze` calls; it enforces pipeline major version compatibility, detects
resource overruns (file count, byte size), and catches plugin failures gracefully — returning
a coverage entry with failure reason rather than throwing. Output coverage records always
include the analyzer id and version.
